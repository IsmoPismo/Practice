    Learn About Radon
  </h1>
  <h2>Radon is a cancer causing, radioactive gas</h2>
  <p>
  You can't see radon. You can't smell radon. You can't taste radon. But radon may be a problem in your home.
  Radon causes thousands of deaths each year. The Surgeon General has warned that radon is the second
  leading cause of lung cancer in the United States. Only smoking causes more lung cancer deaths.
  </p>
  <h2>Radon can be found all over the U.S.</h2>
  <p>
  Radon comes from the natural (radioactive) breakdown of uranium in soil, rock, and water and gets into the air you breathe.
  Radon can be found all over the U.S. and can get into any type of building â€” homes, offices, and schools.
  You and your family are most likely to get your greatest exposure at home, where you spend most of your time.
  </p>
  <h2>You should test for radon</h2>
  <p>
  Testing is the only way to know if you and your family are at risk from radon. The EPA and the Surgeon General recommend testing all homes.
  Testing is inexpensive and easy. It will only take a few minutes of your time.
  </p>

  <h2>You can fix a radon problem</h2>
  <p>
  Radon reduction systems work and they are not too costly. Some radon reduction systems can reduce radon levels in your home by up to 99%.
  Even very high levels can be reduced to acceptable levels.
  </p>
  <h2>How does radon get into your home?</h2>
  <p>
  Radon is a radioactive gas. It comes from the natural decay of uranium that is found in nearly all soils. It typically moves up through
  the ground and into your home through cracks and other holes in the foundation. Your home traps radon inside where it can build up.
  Any home may have a radon problem. This means new and old homes, well-sealed and drafty homes, and homes with or without basements.

  <h2>The testing process</h2>
  <p>
Testing your home for radon is easy. Simply call us and book an appointment.
The appointment will take place at your house. One of our technicians
will come to your home and install testing equipment. The equipment is
small and quiet. The equipment will be placed in an unobtrusive location. Setting up the equipment only takes a few minutes. After two days, our technician will come back to your house, pick up the equipment, interpret your results, answer questions, and provide solutions.
  </p>
  <h2>Testing fees</h2>
  <p>
  Testing your home for radon is very affordable. The fee for testing is normally $250 but we are offering a special
  promotion through the end of the month which offers testing for only $99

  <h2>How to lower radon levels in your home</h2>
  <p>
  There is no known safe level of radon. You can reduce your risk by decreasing radon levels in your home.
  There are several proven methods to reduce radon in your home. The method primarily used is a vent pipe
  and fan, which pulls radon from beneath the house and vents it to the outside. This system, known as a
  soil suction radon reduction system, does not require major changes to your home. Sealing foundation
  cracks and other openings makes this kind of system more effective and cost-efficient. Similar systems
  can be installed in houses with crawl spaces. Our licensed contractors might use other methods.
  The right system depends on the design of your home.
  </p>
  <p>
  Lowering high radon levels requires technical knowledge and special skills. Our contractors are licensed and trained to fix radon problems. We will study the radon problem in your home and find the best solution for lowering radon levels in your home.
  </p>
  <p>
  After we have installed a system for lowering radon levels in your home, we will test your home again to ensure that radon levels have been reduced to a safe level. Our soil suction radon reduction systems also include a monitor that will indicate whether the system is operating properly.

    ABOUT US
  </h1>
  <h2>Our company, our family</h2>
  <p>
    We are a local, family-run business.
    We began this business because we became aware of the cancer-causing hazard that radon poses.
    After our son was born, I learned that children are particularly susceptible to the negative
    health impacts of radon. At the time there was no local business that provided radon testing
    or mitigation. In order to keep our family safe, we educated ourselves. We learned how to test
    for radon and how to reduce radon levels. The first radon mitigation system we installed was in
    our home. I am happy that our home is now free from the unnecessary danger of hazardously
    high radon levels.
  </p>
  <p>
    Helping people stay safe, helping people protect their families, and helping people avoid cancer is
    what our business is all about. As we talked to friends and family about radon, we realized there
    are many people who can benefit from what we  have learned. We partnered with our cousin who is a
    licensed general contractor and our business was born.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our goal is to help people stay healthy so that they can live and enjoy their lives.
