    Learn About Radon
  </h1>
  <h2>Radon is a cancer causing, radioactive gas</h2>
  <p>
  You can't see radon. You can't smell radon. You can't taste radon. But radon may be a problem in your home.
  Radon causes thousands of deaths each year. The Surgeon General has warned that radon is the second
  leading cause of lung cancer in the United States. Only smoking causes more lung cancer deaths.
  </p>
  <h2>Radon can be found all over the U.S.</h2>
  <p>
  Radon comes from the natural (radioactive) breakdown of uranium in soil, rock, and water and gets into the air you breathe.
  Radon can be found all over the U.S. and can get into any type of building â€” homes, offices, and schools.
  You and your family are most likely to get your greatest exposure at home, where you spend most of your time.
  </p>
  <h2>You should test for radon</h2>
  <p>
  Testing is the only way to know if you and your family are at risk from radon. The EPA and the Surgeon General recommend testing all homes.
  Testing is inexpensive and easy. It will only take a few minutes of your time.

  <h2>You can fix a radon problem</h2>
  <p>
  Radon reduction systems work and they are not too costly. Some radon reduction systems can reduce radon levels in your home by up to 99%.
  Even very high levels can be reduced to acceptable levels.
  </p>
  <h2>How does radon get into your home?</h2>
  <p>
  Radon is a radioactive gas. It comes from the natural decay of uranium that is found in nearly all soils. It typically moves up through
  the ground and into your home through cracks and other holes in the foundation. Your home traps radon inside where it can build up.
  Any home may have a radon problem. This means new and old homes, well-sealed and drafty homes, and homes with or without basements.
