    Learn About Radon
  </h1>
  <h2>Radon is a cancer causing, radioactive gas</h2>
  <p>
  You can't see radon. You can't smell radon. You can't taste radon. But radon may be a problem in your home.
  Radon causes thousands of deaths each year. The Surgeon General has warned that radon is the second
  leading cause of lung cancer in the United States. Only smoking causes more lung cancer deaths.
  </p>
  <h2>Radon can be found all over the U.S.</h2>
  <p>
  Radon comes from the natural (radioactive) breakdown of uranium in soil, rock, and water and gets into the air you breathe.
  Radon can be found all over the U.S. and can get into any type of building â€” homes, offices, and schools.
  You and your family are most likely to get your greatest exposure at home, where you spend most of your time.
  </p>
  <h2>You should test for radon</h2>
  <p>
  Testing is the only way to know if you and your family are at risk from radon. The EPA and the Surgeon General recommend testing all homes.
  Testing is inexpensive and easy. It will only take a few minutes of your time.

  <h2>You can fix a radon problem</h2>
  <p>
  Radon reduction systems work and they are not too costly. Some radon reduction systems can reduce radon levels in your home by up to 99%.
  Even very high levels can be reduced to acceptable levels.
  </p>
  <h2>How does radon get into your home?</h2>
  <p>
  Radon is a radioactive gas. It comes from the natural decay of uranium that is found in nearly all soils. It typically moves up through
  the ground and into your home through cracks and other holes in the foundation. Your home traps radon inside where it can build up.
  Any home may have a radon problem. This means new and old homes, well-sealed and drafty homes, and homes with or without basements.

  Millions of Americans have already tested their homes for radon.
  Keep yourself and your family safe. Test today.
  </p>
  <h2>The testing process</h2>
  <p>
Testing your home for radon is easy. Simply call us and book an appointment.
The appointment will take place at your house. One of our technicians
will come to your home and install testing equipment. The equipment is
small and quiet. The equipment will be placed in an unobtrusive location. Setting up the equipment only takes a few minutes. After two days, our technician will come back to your house, pick up the equipment, interpret your results, answer questions, and provide solutions.
  </p>
  <h2>Testing fees</h2>
  <p>
  Testing your home for radon is very affordable. The fee for testing is normally $250 but we are offering a special
  promotion through the end of the month which offers testing for only $99
